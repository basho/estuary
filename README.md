Estuary Definition:
---
An [estuary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary) estuary is a partly enclosed coastal body of brackish water with 
one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea. Estuaries form a transition zone 
between river environments and maritime environments and are subject to both marine influences, such as tides, waves, and the 
influx of saline water; and riverine influences, such as flows of fresh water and sediment. The inflows of both sea water and 
fresh water provide high levels of nutrients in both the water column and sediment, making estuaries among the most productive 
natural habitats in the world.
Project Definition:
---
The idea behind this project is to bring together several data sources derived from various APIs and provide a
wrapped up version of the APIs via a centralized API. Basically an API of APIs. Very meta I know, but it's good stuff.
